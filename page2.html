            <h1>Flamingo Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>There are only six species of flamingos in the world, though several of those species have subspecies divisions and could eventually be split into different unique species. All flamingos belong to the bird family Phoenicopteridae.</li>
                <li>Flamingos are found around the world from the Caribbean and South America to Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. They are also popular guests in many zoos, aviaries, aquariums, marine parks, and botanical gardens well outside their native ranges. Occasional escaped flamingos often make headlines among birders.</li>
                <li>The word "flamingo" comes from the Spanish and Latin word "flamenco" which means fire, and refers to the bright color of the birds' feathers. Not all flamingos are brightly colored, however, and some of the birds are mostly gray or white. The strength of a flamingo's coloration comes from its diet. Younger birds also have less coloration.</li>
                <li>While flamingos are considered wading birds, the same classification as herons, egrets, spoonbills, and cranes, they are most closely related to grebes genetically.</li>
